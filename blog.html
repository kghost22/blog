            Imagine if I was given one moment,
            just a single slice of my past.
            I could hold it close forever,
            and that moment would always last.

            I'd put the moment in a safe,
            within my heart's abode.
            I could open it when I wanted,
            and only I would know the code.

            I could choose a time of laughing,
            a time of happiness and fun.
            I could choose a time that tried me
            through everything I've done.

            
            For me to only pick one moment
            to cherish, save and keep
            is proving really difficult,
            as I've gathered up a heap!

            


        </p>
        <p>
            I sat and thought about what moment
            would always make me smile.
            One that would always push me
            to walk that extra mile.

            If I'm feeling sad and low,
            if I'm struggling with what to do,
            I can go and open my little safe
            and watch my moment through.

            There are moments I can think of
            that would lift my spirits every time.
            The moments when you picked me up,
            when the road was hard to climb.

        </p>
        <p>
            I've dug deep inside my heart,
            found the safe and looked inside
            There was room for lots of moments;
            in fact, hundreds if I tried.

            I'm building my own little library,
            embedded in my heart,
            for all the moments spent with you
            before you had to part.

            I can open it up whenever I like,
            pick a moment and watch it through,
            My little library acts as a promise
            I'll never ever forget you.

            How Can I Say Goodbye?

            Mom, it's been over a year now since
            God and His angels called you away.
            Oh, how the angels rejoiced as you walked
            Through those pearly gates that day!

            Mom, when they said you were going to die
            I refused to believe it could be true.
            How could I allow myself to even
            Imagine saying goodbye to you?


        </p>
        <p>
            Mom, you were an angel here on earth,
            I learned so very much from you.
            You were so gentle and so kind; your
            Smile would always see me through.

            You taught me how to love unconditionally
            And how to be my very best in all I do.
            You gave your all to God and your family,
            Never once stopping to think about you.


        </p>
        <p>
            You were more than a mother. You were my
            Best friend and a great listener, too.
            Oh, how I miss our special talks and
            All the fun things we used to do.

            Mom, I can never say goodbye to you,
            Because I could never bear the pain.
            Instead, I say I love you, Mom;
            Until we meet again.
